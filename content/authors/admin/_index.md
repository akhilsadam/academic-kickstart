I'm a undergraduate student interested in computational physics.  

Currently, I am developing a novel whole-body Positron Emission Tomography detector as part of the UTKL Research Group (under Dr. Karol Lang, at the University of Texas at Austin).  
As part of the Phonon Momentum Group (with Dr. John Markert, also at UT Austin), we are investigating the angular momentum of lattice phonons in ferrite samples. 

I also explore simple computer science algorithms, produce physics simulations, art, and music.
