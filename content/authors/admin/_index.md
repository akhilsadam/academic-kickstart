I'm a dual-credit high-school student interested in computational high-energy particle physics. Currently, I am starting a research volunteership under Dr. Karol Lang at the University of Texas at Austin.
I enjoy participating in the Physics Olympiad and Chemistry Olympiad competitions. As a USAPhO bronze medalist, this year, I am hoping to make the physics camp.

I conduct personal research on graph theory and other algorithmic math and computer science, most of which can be found on my Github. In my free time, I also produce games, physics simulations, and music with Unity, Blender, and FL Studio.
A complete resume is available here, and my project portfolio is available <a href="../../content/files/Resume/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
