I'm an undergraduate student interested in computational physics.  

At the UTKL Research Group, I am developing a novel whole-body plastic Positron Emission Tomography detector.  
At the Phonon Momentum Group, I investigate the angular momentum of lattice phonons in ferrite samples. 

I also explore simple computer science algorithms, produce physics simulations, art, and music.
